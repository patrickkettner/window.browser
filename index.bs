  ## Introduction {#introduction}
  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Browser extensions are programs to extend the capabilities of web browsers.
  Although not standardized at first, web browsers have independently implemented a common interoperable set of extension APIs, called WebExtensions.

  Modern WebExtensions are an evolution of a system originally introduced in
  Chrome version 3. In that system, any API that was added was put under the
  <code>chrome</code> namespace. When WebExtensions were adopted outside of
  Chromium, other vendors used the more neutral <code>browser</code> namespace.
  That <code>browser</code> is now considered to canonically correct namespace
  for all WebExtension APIs.  Some interactions with WebExtensions (such as
  external messaging from content scripts to background processes) necessitate
  the exposure of this namespace to the web.

  Given that, this document defines <code>window.browser</code> as reserved for
  the use of APIs designed to interact with WebExtensions. The specifics of what
  APIs within <code>window.browser</code> are at present intentionally undefined,
  and are left up to User Agent implementation.

      <a attribute lt="browser"><code>window.browser</code></a> API
    </h3>

    {{browser}} is UA defined attribute exposed on {{window}}. When implemented,
    it MUST be used only for WebExtension related functionality.
  </section>


<pre class="idl">
  partial interface Window {
   attribute object browser;
  };

</pre>

    <h3 id="worker-interface">
      Worker API
    </h3>

    When {{browser}} is defined on {{window}}, it SHOULD also be implemented on {{ServiceWorkerGlobalScope}} and {{DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope}}.
    It MUST be used exclusivly for WebExtension purposes, however the contents of each instance of {{browser}} is UA defined.

<pre class="idl">
  partial interface DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope {
    attribute object browser;
  };

  partial interface ServiceWorkerGlobalScope {
    attribute object browser;
  };
